# Data Repository

This repository contains data for my personal projects, which is usually a blog post on [my website](https://www.alexcookson.com/), a submission to [#TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday), something to practice web scraping and data cleaning on, or some combination of these.

Feel free to use this data, but none of it belongs to me, so please do so in accordance with the dataset's license. You don't need to cite me if you use something I scraped or cleaned. (But I would love to hear about what you're doing with it!)

And if you have any questions, please [@ me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/alexcookson) (or DM if you prefer). It makes my day whenever I'm able to help someone, even if it's just answering a quick question!



### Repository Structure

Each dataset has its own folder with the following structure. **Bold** text signifies a folder. Normal text represents files:

**data-folder**
- README.md (description, data dictionary, and link to original source)
- clean data files (usually in CSV format)
- **raw**
  - original data files (if the raw folder exists, these files needed to be cleaned)
- **ref**
  - reference documents (e.g., license, data dictionary from the data source)
- **src**
  - scripts (to scrape or clean the original data)
