# Data Repository

This repository contains data for [Alex Cookson](https://twitter.com/alexcookson)'s personal projects. Each dataset has its own folder with the following structure. **Bold** text signifies a folder. Normal text represents files:

**data-folder**
- README.md (short description and data dictionary)
- clean data files (usually in CSV format)
- **raw**
  - original data files (if the raw folder exists, these files needed to be cleaned)
- **ref**
  - reference documents (e.g., license, data dictionary from the data source)
- **src**
  - scripts (usually to scrape or clean the original data)
