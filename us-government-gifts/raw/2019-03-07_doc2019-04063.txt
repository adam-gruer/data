[Public Notice: 10695]


Office of the Chief of Protocol; Gifts to Federal Employees From 
Foreign Government Sources Reported To Employing Agencies in Calendar 
Year 2017

    The Office of the Chief of Protocol, Department of State, submits 
the following comprehensive listing of the statements which, as 
required by law, federal employees filed with their employing agencies 
during calendar year 2017 concerning gifts received from foreign 
government sources. The compilation includes reports of both tangible 
gifts and gifts of travel or travel expenses of more than minimal 
value, as defined by the statute. Also included are gifts received in 
previous years including one gift in 2011, four gifts in 2012, two 
gifts in 2013, two gifts in 2014, seven gifts in 2015, and one gift 
with an unknown date. These latter gifts are being reported in this 
year's report as the Office of the Chief of Protocol, Department of 
State, did not receive the relevant information to include them in 
earlier reports. Any agency not listed in this report either did not 
receive any gifts during the calendar year or did not respond to the 
Office of the Chief of Protocol's call for data.
    Publication of this listing in the Federal Register is required by 
Section 7342(f) of Title 5, United States Code, as added by Section 
515(a)(l) of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 1978
