# US Government Gifts

**Data cleaning still in progress!**



This data is about gifts to U.S. federal employees from foreign government sources, such as when a foreign leader visits the U.S. and presents the President with a gift. This [article](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/02/the-unusual-gifts-given-to-presidents/462831/) from *The Atlantic* (soft paywall) lists some notable gifts.

Data is from [FederalRegister.gov](https://www.federalregister.gov/), a website operated by the [U.S. Office of the Federal Register](http://www.archives.gov/federal-register/) and the [U.S. Government Publishing Office](http://www.gpo.gov/). In simple terms, it's a website for finding U.S. government documents.
