# Japanese Mascots (Yuru-chara)

[Yuru-chara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuru-chara) are Japanese mascot characters, often representing towns or organizations. Western audiences, if they are familiar with yuru-chara at all, might know [*Chiitan*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiitan), who was featured on *Last Week Tonight With John Oliver*.

These mascots are often silly and whimsical, and they are definitely [*kawaii*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawaii) (cute)! The Twitter account [Mondo Mascots](https://twitter.com/mondomascots) regularly posts pictures and descriptions of the many mascots that exist. Chris Carlier, curator of Mondo Mascots, was also featured on an episode of *99% Invisible*, [Return of the Yokai](https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/return-of-the-yokai/).

The data is from the official website of the [Yuru-Chara Grand Prix](https://www.yurugp.jp/jp/) (Japanese), an annual competition where the public votes for their favourite yuru-chara. The English translation of names, areas, organizations, and descriptions was done using Google's [Cloud Translation API](https://cloud.google.com/translate), so if there is any weird phrasing or syntax, it is likely a result of automated translation.
