# Japanese Mascots (Yuru-chara)

***Work in progress. This requires accessing an API that is in Japanese, which will be a new challenge for me, so don't expect final data on this anytime soon!***

[Yuru-chara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuru-chara) are Japanese mascot characters, often representing towns or organizations. Western audiences, if they are familiar with them at all, might know [*Chiitan*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiitan), who was featured on *Last Week Tonight With John Oliver*.

These mascots are often silly and whimsical, and they are definitely [*kawaii*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawaii) (cute)! The Twitter account [Mondo Mascots](https://twitter.com/mondomascots) regularly posts pictures and descriptions of the many mascots that exist!

This data, when it becomes available, will be from [localchara.jp](http://localchara.jp/services/api) (Japanese), a website that includes an API for a database of mascots.
