But when it comes to Ebetsu-chan, it's definitely this rice ball! ! I always carry my favorite rice ball with me. What to do with this... Throw! And suddenly! ! To tell the truth, this rice ball is called ""Fukumusubi"" and make everyone smile and make everyone happy! Ebecchan is throwing with the thought that. If you receive this Fukumusubi, don't just throw it back, but put your painful and sad feelings into the Fukumusubi and throw it back to Ebechan. Ebechan eats that painful and sad feeling. If you see Ebechan, please try this ""rice ball catch"". And Ebechan is working hard as a tourist ambassador for Hyogo Prefecture's Mita City to promote PR activities in Hyogo and Mita nationwide. Sanda is not only delicious Mita rice and Mita beef, but also many tourist attractions and places to shop. For example, “Kobe Mita Premium Outlets” at the door of Mita, which is well known. Ebechan goes to the staff to see fashionable clothes and hats. The ""Museum of People and Nature"" also displays bones and fossils of dinosaurs excavated in Japan. While being surprised by the powerful dinosaur fossil, I wondered if the mammoth meat was delicious? I was witnessing the appearance of Ebetchan wiping the drool. In this way, in order to let many people know about the city of Mita, which I love, I want to accompany the Taiyaku, the companion, and today, the Ebisu Maru, which is Mita beef, who is on leave at Mita. Together, I am traveling all over the country. We look forward to your continued support of Ebechan! !"

To tell the truth, this rice ball is called ""Fukumusubi"" and make everyone smile and make everyone happy! Ebecchan is throwing with the thought that. If you receive this Fukumusubi, don't just throw it back, but put your painful and sad feelings into the Fukumusubi and throw it back to Ebechan. Ebechan eats that painful and sad feeling. If you see Ebechan, please try this ""rice ball catch"". And Ebechan is working hard as a tourist ambassador for Hyogo Prefecture's Mita City to promote PR activities in Hyogo and Mita nationwide. Sanda is not only delicious Mita rice and Mita beef, but also many tourist attractions and places to shop. For example, “Kobe Mita Premium Outlets” at the door of Mita, which is well known. Ebechan goes to the staff to see fashionable clothes and hats. The ""Museum of People and Nature"" also displays bones and fossils of dinosaurs excavated in Japan. While being surprised by the powerful dinosaur fossil, I wondered if the mammoth meat was delicious? I was witnessing the appearance of Ebetchan wiping the drool. In this way, in order to let many people know about the city of Mita, which I love, I want to accompany the Taiyaku, the companion, and today, the Ebisu Maru, which is Mita beef, who is on leave at Mita.

If you see Ebechan, please try this ""rice ball catch"". And Ebechan is working hard as a tourist ambassador for Hyogo Prefecture's Mita City to promote PR activities in Hyogo and Mita nationwide. Sanda is not only delicious Mita rice and Mita beef, but also many tourist attractions and places to shop. For example, “Kobe Mita Premium Outlets” at the door of Mita, which is well known.
