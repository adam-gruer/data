# Fictional Character Personalities

This data contains crowd-sourced personality traits of 800 fictional characters from numerous fictional works. Each character is scored on 264 adjective-pair spectrums, such as "trusting / suspicious" or "luddite / technophile".

To illustrate, let's look at two of my favourite fictional characters: Michael Scott from *The Office* and Worf from *Star Trek*. We'll look at where they are on the "playful / serious" spectrum.

- **Michael Scott** has a mean score of -41.7 (on a -50 to +50 scale), a **low score** indicating he is **very playful**. (After all, he is a friend first, boss second, and entertainer third!)
- **Worf** has a mean score of 43.2 (on a -50 to +50 scale), a **high score** indicating he is **very serious**. (Worf himself states that he "is not a merry man".)



#### Data Source

The data comes from the [Open-Source Psychometrics Project](https://openpsychometrics.org/)'s online ["Which Character" personality quiz](https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/characters/). According to the quiz website:

In other words, don't take it too seriously. :tada: â€‹It's just a bit of fun! :tada:
